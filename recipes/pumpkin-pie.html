        <h2>Perfect Pumpkin pie</h2>
            <p>This recipe has been in my family for generations. It is the perfect blend of spices and pumpkin.</p>
            <p>When you take this to your next holiday gathering everyone will thank you. This recipe goes beyond pumpkin spice.</p> 
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
         <ul>
            <li>1 (9inch) graham cracker crust</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 (15 oz) can of pure pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>3/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
         </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Whisk the eggs and both sugars together until smooth.<p>Add pumpkin puree, cream, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt.</p>Whisk until well blended.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (218°C). Set aside a large baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Place the pie dish on your baking sheet. Pour the pumpkin filling into the pie shell.</li>
            <li>Bake the pumpkin pie at 425°F (218°C) for 15 minutes. <p>Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until a toothpick or thin knife plunged it into the pie, about 2 inches from the edge, comes out clean.</p> Rotate once or twice during baking. If, while the pie is baking, the top of the crust becomes too dark, cover it with a thin strip of aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Cool completely on a wire rack for 2 to 3 hours or until room temperature.<p>Serve or refrigerate overnight (the pie sets even more after a night in the fridge).</p></li>
            <li>Cut into eight wedges and serve alone or topped with whipped cream.</li>
